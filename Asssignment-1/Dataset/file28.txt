Ive playing 9 years worried wont par midend guitar Ive using The guitar looks feels great The finish well done Its got warm full sound I really enjoyed times I found reluctant stop playing And I really pleased smooth fretting felt like took less effort move frets press several guitars Ive played previously The gripe I fret position markers dots really dark hard spot see pictures But thats deal breaker means since playing would normally look markers side neck pretty clear Still aesthetically dark markers dont look nice But overall I quite impressed especially great price You know guitar good encourages play often makes hard stop put
