Awesome bass I love As reviewers commented bass balanced standard solid body bass neck definitely heavier due hollow body know thats way goes I love sound hollow body gives sounds bit like acoustic bass The controls give nice variety sounds I something novice player wanted add hollow body bass small collection Hofner replica ticket I think I might replace strings came sound metallic taste playable hold tune well I able play bass right box I tuned No need adjusting didnt fret buss reviewers commented I notice neck slimmer strings closer together basses adjustment didnt take long get swing things Fun play lightweight Recommended
