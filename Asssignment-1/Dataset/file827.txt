Purchased 5hole pickguard eggshell MIM Baja Telecaster Honestly I wasnt expecting much since I hated cheap white plastic version came stock Black Bakelite looked good gold anodized aluminum looked better somehow one seems right Its heavy vintage thickness rigid high quality The eggshell color adds enough warmth well There shielding may want slap copper foil back Note NOT Squiers made Japan Should fit USA MIM models
