On day picks arrived I went gig put one pocket I set gear Maybe twenty minutes later I took pick pocket found already shed cork grip The following day I played another picks 90 minutes At point cork grip already peeled pick Obviously whatever adhesive manufacturer using crap Once grip gone left plain celluloid pick much like Fender sells My advice dont waste time money things Buy Fender picks done
