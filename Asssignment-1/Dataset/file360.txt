Bought brass tip didnt need rest Just wanted beef Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus make gold hardware match Does job perfectly But warned added weight metal gives switch much heavier thicker clicking sound switching pup positions It doesnt bother I play metal sound doesnt come amp But clean players heavy clunk might audible amp However I would still give shot see like even hear looks great everyone hears music differently And I actually like added chunky feel Makes Grail feel bit tough
