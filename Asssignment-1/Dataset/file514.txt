I four I purchased local guitar shop didnt buy amazon They exact cables however I think far stiff rigid Example see visible wrinkles feel tension work plugging pedals I mean quite bit resistance unnecessary amount Durable yes thats great Im running pedalboard guitars Not pullin trucks mud pits damn They sound okay nothing special Look pretty cool looks arent whats getting done Overpriced opinion fender cables Not huge fan prefer lower profile pancake type patch cables mogami sounds better easier work pedals kept much neater closer save space That means room toys Hooked pedals together board took couple pics get idea tension overall opinion sloppy fit cables
