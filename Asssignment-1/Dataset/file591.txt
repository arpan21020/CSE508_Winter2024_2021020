First NOT leather strap Only ends leather Ive owned model 3 several times I keep coming back style But glue use piece front back together stand sweat So separates pretty quickly 4 uses The sad thing strap made quite well except plastic end holds nylon strap part If breaks 2000 plus guitar takes dive Using strap locks I would prefer used metal part instead plastic part But separation real downer All would sew use better glue They must know factory defect many years straps done exact separation exact place Total I purchased dozen straps guitars
