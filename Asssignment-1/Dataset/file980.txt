New fave strings Fender Jaguar Jazzmaster It gives offsets extra balls Unlike many flats tend sound dullplucky higher tension would still give enough brightness liveliness surprisingly balanced sound throughout strings It tuned fast stays tuned weeks need VERY minor tuning every Even wounded G doesnt bother pretty subtle almost wouldnt feel Its actually CHEAP considering long strings would last This last brand strings I use
