Adds nice touch originality I paired Fender tweed strap maybe little bit overkill F sign everywhere Ok ok KNOW Fender come They kind massive installed doesnt look bad bulky Only problem I I previously installed set Dunlop straplocks substituting new Fender screw fell kind short never got tight always stayed turning around screwing So I use previous Dunlop screws new Fender ones worked like charm Not problem product one used something else one might kinds issues later Not easy lock guitar models one requires two fingers adjust instead instance Dunlops central button Just sure guitar strapped let go
