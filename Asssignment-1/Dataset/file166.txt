Tiny little amp I never seen retail shops I ordered After putting 9V battery plugged Gretsch guitar instantly I heard punching sound rockabilly Never I ever heard strange sounds feedback popping screeching It quiet perfect even I played real close amp I purchase DC adaptor relying batteries Imagine I could play electric guitar car portable thing The bad thing box packaging looks cheap printing bad The brand name amp located back kind shy telling others Fender At first I suspected fake However sound doesnt lie I realized amp cost others sure brands equally good well
