I wanted say Fender Vintage Noiseless Pickups great upgrade 2012 Fender Standard Stratocaster They provide much cleaner belllike tone compared factoryfitted pickups The factory pickups actually great gritty blues rock playing mostly clean I prefer sound Vintage Noiseless Also package I got updated wiring diagram correct issue didnt show connect output jack hot wire shown wiring diagram Fenders website American Deluxe Stratocaster I installed new pots capacitors resistor came package gave cleanest brightest tone If want warmer tone probably skip
