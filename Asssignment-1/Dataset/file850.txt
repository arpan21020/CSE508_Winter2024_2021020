This great sounding great price Is perfect No less perfect something costing lot sounding good pedal I read one review guy satisfied said sounded like 80s glam rock I totally disagree If play decent amp get variety great sounds little box It seems like many players like fuzzy buzzy type overdrive sound I prefer thicker creamy sound dial pedal For mere 35 I willing roll dice I found diamond rough
