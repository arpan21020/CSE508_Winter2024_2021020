I tested fog fluid 1byone 400W fogger Two 30 second bursts sufficient create enough fog layers moody atmosphere 2 car garage This hot space I pleasantly surprised long fog would linger It would quickly rise eye level hang Another nice surprise odor much step middle thick pocket smells like lavender soap Only downside fog dense The difference 2 bursts 5 bursts pronounced grey mist become white truly opaque visibility remaining 9 feet
