Thus 5 star review sadly 3 I bought cymbal eBay mess I got next nothing figured I would clean Cleaner sure worked well THANKFULLY I read use Letters Holy cow I close cleaning areas thankfully someone called I read entire bottle end So finished product see A far better cleaned cymbal still looks like wreck around Letters Oh well Light years better eBay mess I bought But I sorely wish I could clean around lettering fear losing lettering You would think Zildjian would able make cleaning product works well around Letters
