Looking guitar dont single wrap post I found hard believe strings would even stay I installed two sets two different guitars One black set gold The first guitar would stay tune I tried They nearly year totally fixed tuning problem The second set I put brand new Gibson Les Paul first ones worked well Super easy fast string changes auto trim feature tuning issues At 181 gear ratio dial perfect tune hold I prefer Grover higher priced tuners available I added pictures The new tuners covered holes Les Paul looks great back The Other Ibanez AR420 You see original mounting holes I filled wood putty use model car paint match cover spots
