The first one I used work After troubleshooting I solder tone control switched volume pot seemed shorted perhaps much heat ground soldering back factory Everything worked still hum I eliminated running effects pedal The second one worked overwhelming static hum cheap I wired bypassing controls plugged separate volume pedal amp It works fine little hum I may still use future inexpensive I would use better expensive pickups better quality guitars In future one inexpensive projects I would probably order pickup without wiring harness controls But rethinking even buying output jack bit shielded cable Radio Shack would expensive end You cant beat price
