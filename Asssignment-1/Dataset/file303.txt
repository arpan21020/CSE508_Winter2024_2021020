We used one middle seen picture holding white guitar BIG MISTAKE The guitar almost destroyed This NOT strong enough hold 7 string Schecter Omen guitar While worked seemed secure first Literally 7 days later guitar almost fell floor I wouldnt recommend heavier guitars Instead keeping guitar stand safer
