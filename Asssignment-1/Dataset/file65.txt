When I bought Roland Gaia I needed another stand I already two keyboards double tiered stand I think 3 much The least expensive stand available store 30 I figured I get something used local Checking Amazon I saw stand time order 2000 even It seemed like great value I ordered The packaging little flimsy stand arrived one piece good condition It fit Gaia perfectly The included straps dont work Gaia stand holds keyboard well right height Its little beefier stands price range though beefy 2 tier stand though much expensive This totally five star stand price I paid even 500 time review For inexpensive stand I dont think anyone better Recommended
