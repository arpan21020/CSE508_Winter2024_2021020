Fits Squier Stratocaster Bullet great inches spare lengthwise Theres ton great zipper pockets handles great padding pretty decent I use light traveling cheaper guitars In opinion I would put expensive guitar padding isnt best still resist scratches small bangs likely drops If expensive Fender anything cherish collection Id go strong solid case This gig bag mostly around house storage cheaper guitars wouldnt care much dropped got damaged Overall Im happy guitar gig bag definitely order another one Plus price hard pass Perfect
