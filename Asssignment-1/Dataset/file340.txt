I love DAddario strings however particular set installed 28625 scale 8string top 74 string wound far enough reach nut This left roughly 13 string match Pic Im honestly sure isolated incident packs yield result I give another try hopes better set standard DAddario really consider extended scale 8string guitars ensure strings wound far enough
